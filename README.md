# Python Image Scraping with Azure

This repository contains a Python project for image scraping and processing, utilizing Azure services. It is designed to demonstrate how to scrape images from websites and integrate them with Azure for storage, analysis, or further processing.

## Features

- **Image Scraping**: Extract images from the web with ease using Python libraries.
- **Azure Integration**: Store and manage scraped images using Azure Blob Storage or other Azure services.
- **Web Development**: A simple web interface built using HTML and CSS for user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core logic for web scraping and Azure integration.
- **CSS**: Styling for the web interface.
- **HTML**: Structure for the web interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swapnilbilgoji/Python_image_scrapping_azur.git
   cd Python_image_scrapping_azur

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure Azure credentials:
   - Set up an Azure account and create a resource group.
   - Add your Azure storage account and keys in a `.env` file or directly in the script.

## Usage

1. Run the script to start scraping images:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

2. Launch the web interface (if applicable) by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the web interface in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
